And so it happened that I decided to make a Thing. Most people would call it a blog, and quite a few of them would look at me
sideways for starting one in 2022. 

I like to think of it as not-a-blog and will not ever refer to it as one after this point. It's a Thing.

It's a spot that I can jot down things I think of, or run across and want to keep. 

It's a repository of sorts. Mostly crap, but I am quite fond of my crap.

I seriosly doubt anyone will ever read this, and I don't really plan on ever trying to get anyone to do so, so mostly I am writing for the audience of myself. Which means I have the freedom to make in-jokes that only I understand, and then laugh at them later. Suddenly, this is starting to sound like I need professional help, not a Thing.

I am not completely sure what kind of stuff'll end up here, but I can't wait to read it!

**Some other random notes:**
- I just realized since I'm using VS Code to write this in, I don't have spellcheck. On one hand that feels scary. On another, it feels strangely liberating. Like streaking. Here is my illiteracy for all the world to see. Bask in the glory!
- Today is April 1st (at least for another 20 minutes or so). Make of that what you will.
- I was meaning to do a little writeup on the technology that runs the Thing, but I'm running out of day. It's Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Markdown and Netlify. There should be a link to the theme in the footer. I may do a whole song and dance about it all another time.
